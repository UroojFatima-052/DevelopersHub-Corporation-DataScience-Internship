# Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction 

## 1. Objective

- Predict which bank customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer using the Bank Marketing dataset.

## 2. Approach

- Loaded and explored key customer features (age, job, marital status).
- Visualized acceptance behavior across different groups.
- Applied preprocessing (dropping duration, encoding categorical variables, mapping target).
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier to predict loan acceptance.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
- Analyzed customer segments with higher acceptance rates.

## 3. Results & Insights

- Students (31%) and retired customers (25%) have the highest loan acceptance rates.
- Single customers are more likely to accept offers compared to married or divorced groups.
- Age groups 60+ and 18–25 show higher acceptance, while middle-aged groups accept less.

Decision Tree provided clear segmentation and helped identify customer groups most likely to respond positively.
