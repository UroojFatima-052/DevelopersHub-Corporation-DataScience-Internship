# Iris Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis

## Task Objective

The objective was to explore the Iris dataset using Python, understand its structure, visualize key relationships, and practice basic data analysis skills.

## Approach
1. Loaded the dataset using pandas / seaborn
2. Inspected structure using .shape, .columns, .head()
3. Performed summary statistics
4. Created visualizations:
   - Scatter plots
   - Histograms
   - Box plots
   - Correlation checks

5. Explained patterns between sepal/petal measurements

## Results & Insights
- The dataset is balanced across species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
- Setosa is well-separated from the other two species in petal dimensions
- Versicolor and Virginica overlap but show clear separability
- Petal length and petal width are the strongest distinguishing features
- Visualizations clearly show natural clustering of species
